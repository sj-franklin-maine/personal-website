						<p class="para1">I am a driven individual with a passion for computers, and have thus far led an intriguing life characterized by my dedication to programming and the pursuit of knowledge. Born in Florida, I spent the first decade of my childhood exploring the beach in my backyard. However, my life took a significant turn when my family relocated to Maine. It was during this transition that my interest in computers began to blossom.</p>
						<p class="para2">From an early age, I found myself captivated by the world of technology. I would spend hours tinkering with the computers in our home, exploring software applications and learning about how each piece of a computer works. Recognizing my enthusiasm and aptitude, my parents encouraged this passion, fostering an environment to nurture my curiosity.</p>

						<p class="para3">Upon entering high school, I was accepted into a magnet school that emphasized a focus on an accelerated math and science education. It was here that I took my first introductory course in C++, which solidified my love for programming. The course opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities and creative opportunities that coding offered. From that moment on, I knew I had found my calling.</p>
						<p class="para4">Driven by my newfound passion, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently attending the University of Southern Maine, studying computer science, and further honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. My time at university has allowed me to delve into various aspects of programming, but I have developed a particular interest in game development, artificial intelligence, and user interface design.</p>
