					<p class="work-desc">I developed this website specifically for my personal use, employing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its design incorporates various features such as a menu facilitating navigation across multiple HTML pages, a carousel image slider to showcase my projects, and several other minor enhancements. While the website is functional, it is a work in progress and represents one of my earliest ventures into web development. As such, there are areas that require further refinement and improvement.</p>

					<p class="work-desc">As part of a semester-long class project, I collaborated with a team of five other students to develop a game called Snailboarder. SnailBoarder is a single player 3D skateboarding game where you take the role of a skateboarding snail trying to win a competition. Throughout the project, my major contributions were focused on designing and implementing the user interface (UI) elements that would enhance the overall gameplay, as well as contributing to the development of key game mechanics. This involved designing intuitive menus, interactive buttons, visually pleasing icons, and other graphical elements that not only captured the essence of the game but also ensured seamless navigation and an immersive experience for players.</p>

				<p class="work-desc">SimpleText is a project created by the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) that aims to simplify scientific articles and make them more accessible to individuals who may not have a technical background. The project consists of multiple tasks, each building upon the previous one, with a focus on enhancing the readability of research papers. Specifically, Task 1 of the project aims to retrieve relevant articles and their abstracts to queries that could be derived from works found in the Citation Network Dataset. This project explored a few methods that were implemented and tested to find a solution for this task, including using various neural-network models such as CrossEncoders and Pyterrier.</p>

					<a href="https://github.com/sj-franklin-maine/NLP23/tree/main/Labs/Lab4" class="home__social-links"><i class='bx bxl-github'></i></a>			
					<img src="assets/img/unigram-pic.png" alt="" class="work-img2">
					<p class="work-desc">This project involves analyzing the script of the movie "12 Angry Men" to understand the actions and words spoken by each character. The objective is to characterize the jurors based on their behavior in the script. The code uses regular expressions to separate the names of the characters from their lines and actions. The "Foreman" in the film serves as the jury room supervisor. The project proceeds by creating a uni-gram language model for each juror. These models calculate the probabilities of certain words appearing in the lexicon associated with each juror using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and add-one smoothing. This approach prevents confusion since not all words in the script are linked to every juror. Once the uni-gram language models are established, T-SNE plots are created to visualize each juror in a two-dimensional space.</p>
